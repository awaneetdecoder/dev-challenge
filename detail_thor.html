        <h3>
            Thor, the God of Thunder, is not just a superhero—he’s a living myth, a force of nature wrapped in the form of a mighty warrior. As a prince of Asgard, a realm far beyond Earth, Thor’s powers are godly in every sense of the word, making him one of the most formidable beings in the universe.
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Wielder of Mjölnir: The Hammer of the Gods
        </h2><h3>
            At the heart of Thor's power is Mjölnir, a mystical hammer forged in the heart of a dying star. Mjölnir is no ordinary weapon—it can only be lifted by someone truly worthy. With Mjölnir, Thor commands the power of lightning and thunder, summoning storms and channeling bolts of pure energy that can obliterate foes. The hammer also grants him flight, allowing him to soar across realms and battle his enemies with unstoppable force.
        </h3>

        <h2>Godly Strength: The Power of a Storm</h2> <h3>Thor’s physical strength is unmatched. As the son of Odin, the All-Father, Thor possesses the power of an ancient god. His strength is so immense that he can lift mountains, crush enemies with a single blow, and even go toe-to-toe with beings as powerful as the Hulk. When Thor enters a battle, he is like a living tempest, his every strike carrying the weight of a thousand storms.</h3>
        <h2>Immortal Warrior: Eternal and Invincible</h2>
        <h3>
            As an Asgardian, Thor is ageless and nearly invulnerable. He can survive in the depths of space, endure blows that would crush mortal beings, and heal from injuries that would be fatal to any other. Thor has fought in wars across the cosmos for thousands of years, making him one of the most skilled and fearsome warriors in all the realms.
        </h3>
        <h2>The Odinforce: Beyond Godhood</h2><h3>After ascending to his father’s throne, Thor taps into the Odinforce, a mystical energy that grants him powers beyond even his godly limits. With the Odinforce, Thor can manipulate reality, travel through time and space, and wield powers that rival the cosmos itself. It makes him not just a warrior, but a king capable of shaping the fate of the universe.</h3>
