    <H3>Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is one of the most beloved and iconic superheroes of all time. What makes Spider-Man truly special isn’t just his extraordinary powers, but his deep sense of responsibility and his connection to everyday people. After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker gains incredible abilities that transform him from a shy teenager into the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Let's dive into the amazing powers that define this web-slinging hero!</H3>

    <H2>Superhuman Strength: Mighty Beyond Measure</H2> <H3>One of Spider-Man's most impressive abilities is his superhuman strength. Despite his slender frame, Spider-Man can lift cars, bend steel, and even hold his own against much stronger foes. His strength allows him to perform incredible feats, whether he’s stopping a speeding train with his bare hands or holding collapsing buildings together. Even though Peter is young, his power rivals some of the strongest heroes in the Marvel Universe.</H3>
    <H2>Wall-Crawling: The Ultimate Agility</H2><H3>Spider-Man’s iconic ability to cling to walls and ceilings is one of his most defining powers. Thanks to the special properties of his enhanced physiology, Peter can stick to virtually any surface, giving him the ability to scale skyscrapers with ease. This allows him to move through the city in ways no one else can, disappearing from sight and using the vertical space to his advantage in combat or stealth.</H3>
    <H2>Spider-Sense: A Sixth Sense for Danger</H2><H3>Spider-Man’s spider-sense is one of his most powerful and mysterious abilities. This unique sixth sense gives him an almost precognitive awareness of danger. It warns him of incoming threats, whether it’s a surprise attack, falling debris, or unseen enemies lurking nearby. His spider-sense is so sharp that it allows him to dodge bullets, anticipate moves in a fight, and react to danger before it even happens.</H3>

    <H2>Web-Shooting: The Art of the Web
    </H2> <H3>While Spider-Man’s web-shooting is not a natural power, his genius-level intellect allows him to create web-shooters—mechanical devices that fire strong, sticky webs. These webs are incredibly versatile: Peter uses them to swing through the city, ensnare enemies, build web traps, and even create protective shields. His webs are strong enough to hold down superhuman foes, stop speeding cars, or form massive web constructs. The way Spider-Man uses his webs in creative ways during battles showcases not just his power, but also his brilliant mind.</H3>
     <H2>Super Agility and Reflexes: Lightning-Fast Movement</H2> <H3>Spider-Man’s agility is beyond human limits, making him one of the most acrobatic heroes in the world. He can perform impossible flips, leaps, and somersaults, dodging attacks with unmatched grace and speed. His reflexes are so heightened that he can react faster than any normal human, allowing him to avoid punches, laser beams, and even incoming missiles. Combined with his spider-sense, his agility makes him nearly untouchable in a fight.</H3>
