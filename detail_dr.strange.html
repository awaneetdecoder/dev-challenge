            <h3>
                Doctor Strange, also known as Stephen Strange, isn’t your typical superhero—he’s the Sorcerer Supreme, the protector of Earth against mystical and otherworldly threats. Once a brilliant but arrogant surgeon, Doctor Strange's life changed forever after a car accident damaged his hands beyond repair. In his desperate search for healing, he discovered the world of magic, unlocking powers that transcend the physical realm.
            </h3>

            <h2>Master of the Mystic Arts: Weaving Magic Like No Other</h2> <h3>
                Doctor Strange is a master of sorcery, able to manipulate reality, summon ancient spells, and bend the very fabric of the universe to his will. He can conjure protective shields, teleport across dimensions, and unleash powerful energy blasts. His knowledge of the mystical arts allows him to fight on a level that few can comprehend, making him one of the most formidable beings in existence.
            </h3>
            <h2>The Cloak of Levitation: A Mind of Its Own</h2> <h3>
                Doctor Strange’s Cloak of Levitation is more than just a piece of clothing—it’s a powerful magical artifact with a personality of its own. The cloak allows him to fly and navigate through the skies, but it also acts independently, aiding Strange in combat by restraining enemies or saving him from danger. The bond between Strange and his cloak adds a dynamic layer to his powers, giving him an extra edge in battle.

            </h3>
            <h2>Dimensional Travel: The Multiverse Explorer</h2><h3>Doctor Strange is the guardian of Earth against threats from beyond our dimension. He can open portals to other worlds and dimensions, using the Sling Ring to travel across the multiverse in an instant. Whether stepping into the Dark Dimension or traversing alternate realities, Strange’s mastery of dimensional magic allows him to navigate spaces that go far beyond human comprehension.</h3>
            <h2>The Power of the Mind: Genius-Level Intellect</h2> <h3>Before becoming a sorcerer, Stephen Strange was one of the world’s most skilled neurosurgeons, which means his intellect is as sharp as his magical abilities. His analytical mind, coupled with his vast knowledge of both science and magic, allows him to tackle problems that others find impossible to solve. He approaches magic with the same precision and expertise that once made him a renowned doctor.</h3>
